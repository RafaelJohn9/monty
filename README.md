## What is Monty?

Monty is a simple, stack-based bytecode language inspired by Python.
It provides a set of operations to manipulate a stack data structure, enabling

- basic arithmetic operations
- data manipulation
- control flow.

## Creating the Monty Interpreter

### Overview

The Monty interpreter was developed as a project to enhance my understanding of low-level programming concepts and data structures. The interpreter reads Monty bytecode files, executes the instructions, and manipulates a stack accordingly.

### Steps Involved

1. **Setting Up the Project Structure**
   - Created a directory structure for source files and headers.

2. **Defining the Core Data Structures**
   - Implemented a doubly linked list to represent the stack.
   - Created structures for stack elements and global variables.

3. **Implementing Bytecode Instructions**
   - Developed functions for each Monty instruction (`push`, `pop`, `pall`, `swap`, `add`, etc.).
   - Ensured error handling and edge case management.

4. **Building the Interpreter Logic**
   - Wrote the main loop to read bytecode files line by line.
   - Parsed each line to identify and execute instructions.

5. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Created test cases to validate the functionality of each instruction.
   - Used debugging tools and techniques to resolve issues.

### Compilation

To compile the Monty interpreter, use the following command:

```bash
cd source_code
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o monty
```
